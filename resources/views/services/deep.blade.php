                Our deep cleaning service entails meticulous attention to detail and covers various specific tasks. We start by thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces such as light switches, doorknobs, and handles to eliminate germs and bacteria. We also pay special attention to cleaning and sanitizing kitchen appliances, including the inside of the oven, refrigerator, and microwave, to remove grease, food residues, and odors.
