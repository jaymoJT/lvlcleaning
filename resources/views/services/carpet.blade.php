                At LVL Cleaning agency, our carpet and upholstery cleaning service encompasses a range of specific tasks. Firstly, thorough vacuuming is performed to remove loose dirt and debris from the surface. This is followed by pre-treatment of stains and heavily soiled areas using eco-friendly cleaning solutions. Our technicians then use specialized equipment, such as steam cleaners or hot water extraction machines, to deeply clean the carpets and upholstery. This process effectively loosens and lifts embedded dirt and grime, while also killing bacteria and eliminating odors.

                Furthermore, our technicians pay attention to detail by carefully treating specific types of stains, such as wine, pet accidents, or food spills, using appropriate stain removal techniques. They also ensure that the cleaning process does not damage the fibers or upholstery materials, as they are trained to handle different types of fabrics and surfaces. With our carpet and upholstery cleaning service, clients can enjoy fresh, clean, and allergen-free carpets and furniture, enhancing the overall cleanliness and comfort of their homes.
